0) Prerequisites (one-time)

Install Git: [git-scm.com] → install, keep defaults.

Install VS Code: [code.visualstudio.com].

Tell Git who you are (once):

Open VS Code → Terminal → New Terminal and run:

git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"


Sign in to GitHub in VS Code (easy auth):

In VS Code, click the Accounts icon (top-right) → Sign in to GitHub → authorize in browser.

Optional (advanced): set up SSH keys and use the SSH remote. If you skip this, HTTPS with Git Credential Manager works fine.

1) Push a brand-new local project to GitHub

Goal: You have a folder on your computer that’s not yet on GitHub.

Open the folder in VS Code (File → Open Folder).

Initialize Git:

Click the Source Control icon (branch symbol) on the left.

Click Initialize Repository.

Create a .gitignore (optional but recommended):

Add a file named .gitignore (e.g., for Node: node_modules/, for Python: __pycache__/).

Stage & commit your first snapshot:

In Source Control, hover each changed file → + (stage), or click + next to Changes to stage all.

Enter a message like Initial commit → press Ctrl/Cmd + Enter (or click the checkmark) to Commit.

Publish to GitHub:

In the Source Control view, click Publish Branch (or Publish to GitHub).

Choose Private or Public. VS Code creates the repo on GitHub and sets the remote.

Verify: You’ll see a “Synchronize Changes” ↕ button in the bottom-left. Click it if prompted to push.

You’re now live on GitHub 🎉
